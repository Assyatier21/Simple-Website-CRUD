# Simple-Website-CRUD
This is the final project of a website programming course, which includes Create, Read, Update and Delete features. The program is directly connected to the local database. The program that I created is a website that displays the hospital database, and don't forget to dump SQL databases into your localhost.<br/>
Tools used in this program : 
- XAMPP v.3.2.4
- PHP 8.0.9
